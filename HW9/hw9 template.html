<h1>Homework 9: GEE Analysis</h1>
<h2>Lauren Robinson</h2>
<h3>This map displays the tree cover patterns within Burke County, which is where I am from. It looks at the tree cover fraction, which is the percent vegetation cover for forest land cover class. 
    This is helpful in indicating how much of Burke County is covered in lands that are classified as forests. The darker green areas have higher forest cover than the purple areas. I then found brownfields and determined the distance
    from brownfields to the forests. The red indicates forest areas that are closer to the brownfields, and the green is further away.
