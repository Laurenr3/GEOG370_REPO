<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
<h2>Lauren Robinson</h2>
<h3>This map displays the conservation lands in Florida as well as the significant rivers. The two geoprocessing tools used were intersection and buffer.
    The intersection between rivers and conservation lands in Florida was used to determine what proportion of the protected forest areas are also river areas. The buffer was used 
to indicate how much of this protected area is limited by being rivers or river beds.    </h3>
