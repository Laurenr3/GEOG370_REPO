<h1>Homework 7: Census Data Ratios and Categories </h1>
<h2>Lauren Robinson</h2>
<h3>I chose to create a ratio of people ages 18-24 with some college education to the total population of peoples ages 18-24 within the population. I multipled this division by 100 in order to create a whole number rather than a decimal.
    This was choosen in order to report how many people in 2021 went almost directly from highschool to college or went within a few years. </h3>
