<h1>Homework 7: Census Data Ratios and Categories </h1>
<h2>Lauren Robinson</h2>
<h3>I chose to create a ratio of people ages 18-24 with some college education to the total population of peoples ages 18-24 within the population. I multipled this division by 100 in order to create a whole number rather than a decimal.
    This was choosen in order to report how many people in 2021 went almost directly from highschool to college or went within a few years. </h3>

    <h3>Equal Count
        Pros: Each interval has an equal proportion of the sample. Each class is equally represented on the map. 
        Cons: May group outliers in categories that are not actually representative of the distribution of the data.

    <h3>Equal Intervals
        Pros: Divided into intervals that are the same size. Each category is given the same proportion of range of values so it is unbiased. It is good at showing values that are over or under represented. 
        Cons: Intervals that are over represented will create a choropleth map that is mostly the same color. </h3>

    <h3>Natural Breaks
        Pros: Minimizes within class variances and maximizes variance between groups. Identifies real classes within the data
        Cons: Not suited for data that has low variance.
